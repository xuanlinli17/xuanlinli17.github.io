In large-scale RL, a "generalist" agent jointly trained on all goals tends to learn faster at the beginning, yet it often suffers from catastrophic ignorance & forgetting, leading to suboptimal final performance. In contrast, a "specialist" agent trained only on a few variations can often achieve high final returns, yet its initial learning has low sample efficiency. To have the best of both worlds, we propose GSL, a novel generalist-specialist learning framework and a well-principled meta-algorithm. We show that our framework pushes the envelope of policy learning on many challenging and popular benchmarks including Procgen, Meta-World and ManiSkill.
